The problem of modelling football data has become increasingly pop- ular in the last few years and many different models have been proposed with the aim of estimating the characteristics that bring a team to lose or win a game, or to predict the score of a particular match. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to address both these aims and test its predic- tive strength on data about the Italian Serie A championship 1991-1992. To overcome the issue of overshrinkage produced by the Bayesian hierar- chical model, we specify a more complex mixture model that results in better fit to the observed data.
